    "<b>Due date</b>: Sunday, 5 Apr 2020 5pm\n",

    "<b>Submission method</b>: Canvas submission\n",

    "<b>Submission materials</b>: completed copy of this iPython notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Late submissions</b>: -20% per day (both week and weekend days counted)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: 10% of mark for class (with 9% on correctness + 1% on quality and efficiency of your code)\n",

    "<b>Materials</b>: See [Using Jupyter Notebook and Python page](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/17601/pages/using-jupyter-notebook-and-python?module_item_id=1678430) on Canvas (under Modules>Resources) for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Gensim. In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To familiarize yourself with NLTK, here is a free online book:  Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper (2009). <a href=http://nltk.org/book>Natural Language Processing with Python</a>. O'Reilly Media Inc. You may also consult the <a href=https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html>NLTK API</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via Canvas. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced on the discussion board; we recommend you check it regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place."

NLTK has a list of words that you can use for matching, see starter code below. Be careful about efficiency with respect to doing word lookups. One extra challenge you have to deal with is that the provided list of words includes only lemmas: your MaxMatch algorithm should match inflected forms by converting them into lemmas using the NLTK lemmatizer before matching. When lemmatising a word, you also need to provide the part-of-speech tag of the word. You should use `nltk.tag.pos_tag` for doing part-of-speech tagging.\n",
